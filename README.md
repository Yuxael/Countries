# Countries
Free IPTV with legally receivable TV channels for Kodi, VLC or other media players as .m3u for Kodi. :-)

# IMPORTANT CHANGES!

Thanks to a few people, both here at Github and on other websites on the Internet, there is an important change here!

We look for the streams, find new streams. Create the entries for the m3u's. We look for the right logos and integrate them into the m3u. That’s all a lot of work. Others who are too lazy to work just take our m3u's and copy our work and then present it as their best work. Something like that is a NoGo!

NOW THAT'S THE END WITH THIS CLAWING IN FREE-IPTV/COUNTRIES!

Of course, the honest users, the genuine users of our m3u's, will have no disadvantages because of certain idiots!

# ALSO IMPORTANT INFORMATION!
